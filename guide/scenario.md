# Scenario
A power company is building a power grid in the town of Fl√•klypa.
All houses which is in need of electricity has to be connected to the power grid, and a plan must be in place in case of power outages.
In this semester assignment your job is to aid in the development of this power grid. In reality such a grid would be built using a variation of different power cables dependent on the power needs of the respective parts of the grid. In this assignment we simplify the task by saying there is only one type of power cable and that it does not matter how many houses are connected though the same cable. Throughout this assignment we will be implementing ``IProblem``.
