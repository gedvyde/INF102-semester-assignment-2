# Grading
This mandatory assignment will count 15 % towards your final grade. You will recieve a score between 0 and 15.
The following rubric will be used to assess you assignment:

## Code Quality
Code quality gives 0-3 points.
* The code must be clear and readable
* Avoid repetition of code
* Utilize concepts from INF101 to write maintainable and modular code

## Runtime Analysis (svar.md)
Runtime analysis gives 0-3 points.
* Every method you use must have a runtime analysis using Big-O notation. You get points if the runtime is correct, but a reduction in score if it is incorrect.
* The runtime analysis must be written in svar.md. In addition to Big-O notation you must add a description of why the method has this runtime.
* The runtime should be expressed using two parameters
    * ``m`` - number of edges in the graph
    * ``n`` - number of nodes in the graph

## Functional and Efficient Algorithms and Datastructures
Correct and appropriate use of algorithms and datastructures gives 0-9 points.
The goal of this task is to write algorithms that both correct and the code runs as efficiently as possible. In this task you will need to use algorithms and datastructures you have learned in this course, for instance: ``LinkedList``, ``ArrayList``, ``HashMap``, ``PriorityQueue``, etc. We will look at every method you have implemented and assess if you have done this as efficiently as possible.

* **Task 1** gives 0-3 points.
    * We will assess if your implementation is functionally correct
    * We will assess whether the methods and classes implemented to complete the task are written as efficiently as possible
* **Task 2** gives 0-3 points.
    * We will assess if your implementation is functionally correct
    * We will assess whether the methods and classes implemented to complete the task are written as efficiently as possible
* **Task 3** gives 0-3 points.
    * We will assess if your implementation is functionally correct
    * We will assess whether the methods and classes implemented to complete the task are written as efficiently as possible
